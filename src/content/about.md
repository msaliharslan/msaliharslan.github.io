# About

When I was in high school I had the chance to attend a program where STEM students at the university showed us a glimpse of their expertise with hands-on experience. I was most fascinated by the software engineering department demo. It was such a joy to code something and saw it in action. That enjoyment sticked with me ever since and I became a real software engineer myself.

I studied electrical engineering, but I was always interested in software. In fact, I took a MOOC Python course during my preparatory year of university. What is more, studying electrical engineering helped me better understand how computers work and allowed me to interact with them on a physical level. Which in return, made me a better developer.

Over the years I worked with various programming languages from block coding on LEGO Mindstorms to programming ARM devices in assembly. As a result, I learned more and put my knowledge to use in different ways. Currently, I work as an embedded C++ developer for Mynaric.

I am a curious person, I try to understand the reasons and mechanisms behind an outcome. Little details are of interest to me as well as the big picture. I look for opportunities to gain more knowledge and ways to become a better person.

If you want to know more or have chat feel free to contact me, I'd love to meet with new people.
